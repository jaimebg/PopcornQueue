## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions Made

This project was built with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and a modern development experience.

- **State Management:** The React `useState` hook was implemented to manage the local state of components. For an application of this scale, it is a lightweight and efficient solution without the need for external libraries such as Redux.
    
- **Styles:** I used **flat CSS** with a modular structure. Each component has its own `.css` file, which keeps styles organized and avoids conflicts.

- **Validation:** **Zod** was used to validate the data received from TMDB, making it easy to catch errors.
    
- **External API:** All movie and series information is obtained from **API of The Movie Database (TMDb)**.
